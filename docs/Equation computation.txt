Alt Image score
Round( (# images with alt text) / (# total images) * 100 )

uniqueness score(e.g. for page urls)
Round( (# unique pages URLs) / (# total pages) * 100 )

length score
Round( (# tags that meet length requirement) / (# total possible tags) * 100 )

content score (e.g. for h1 tags on a site)
Round( (#hasCity + #hasState + #hasMake) / (# total possible tags * 3) * 100 )


Note: Length and content scores are affected by whether the appropriate tags are actually present.  
So a lack of H1 tags on pages will lower the H1 length and content scores.

	Lincoln
	Mobile
	Tacoma
	Orange

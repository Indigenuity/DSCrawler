Site Crawl Report

Contains Proxy IP address used for the crawl
Contains the following for each site crawl:
	Salesforce id
	Crawler Site id 
	Crawler SiteCrawl id
	Seed (Homepage URL)
	Max Crawl Depth (How many layers of links to follow)
	Actual Crawl Depth (How many layers were reached)
	Crawl date
	Number of intrasite URLs acquired (a link to kengarffvw.com will not be followed from kengarff.com)
	Number of attempted URLs (not all URLs are attempted)
	Number of successfully retrieved pages
	Number of failed page retrievals
	Number of unique paths (query strings do not affect unique paths)
	Follow Non Uniques (Did this crawl follow all links regardless of uniqueness?  Usually not, since that risks falling into the rabbit hole of search pages)
	Crawl Status (Completed, interrupted, error)
	
Potential flags
	Number of URLs acquired is too low -- crawler probably didn't get past the first page
	Failed page retrievals are not always a problem but should still be looked at
	Low ratio of non uniques to intrasite URLs indicates deep crawls would be problematic

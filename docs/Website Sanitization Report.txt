Website list sanitization report

Contains the following for each website
	Salesforce id
	Crawler Site id 
	Seed (Original URL)
	Manually entered seed (Original URL after I update it by hand)
	Standardized Seed (add http, etc.)
	Resolved Seed (only different from original URL if redirected)
	Status Code (Was the visit to the URL ultimately successful?)
	Does the URL make sense (used to make recommendation for action)
		Is the URL even valid? (kengarffcom is not a valid URL)
		Generic redirect (http -> https, etc.)
		Path makes sense for homepage (index.html, not staff.html)
		Path includes language specifications (dealer.com/fr/index)
		Query string is necessary or unavoidable (?pid=1 indicates homepage)
		Query string includes language specification (?lang=fr)
		Domain makes sense (nothing on facebook.com)
	Site shares domain with other sites, differentiated only by path (paaco.com websites)
	Recommendation (What to do now)
	
	
	
Possible recommendations
	No action -- original URL is just fine
	Remove from list because defunct (outofbusinessdealer.com doesn't show a website anymore)
	Resolve duplicate listing
	Accept generic update (redirect or update was not a significant change, like https -> http)
	Accept significant update (redirect or update was a significant change, like bobscars.com -> jimsautos.com)
		- might also indicate other changes need to be made to salesforce account, like change of address or account name
	Undecided (Interim recommendation.  Eventually this recommendation should be changed to one of these others)

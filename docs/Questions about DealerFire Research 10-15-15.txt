Questions about DealerFire research

On these questions, they might seem a bit pedantic, but I'm just trying to be thorough so we can get usable data.

	For attributes like 'H1 unique to page?'
		This is information that comes from each page individually.  For a site as a whole, do you want a percentage of the pages that have a unique H1?  Or a yes/no based on that percentage?
		Same question for each attribute that describes a single page
		
	Alt. image tags
		Just want to info on whether they exist, or about their length/content?
		
	URL readability
		Would it suffice to look for big query strings for bad readability or a high occurrence of '-'?  
			'-' is universally used to separate words, so it is a sign of readability.
		Should probably ignore search pages because:
			The example for a bad URL provided in the slideshow can be found on every site with search functionality--so ALL sites.  Search URLs are not designed to be readable.

	Keyword Stuffing
		Is it enough to know the title is in the 50-65 character range?  Stuffing can be subjective, even for human readers.
		A check for excessive commas would find most stuffers, but not all.  Should I include this test?
		
	Responsive detection
		Just checking for presence of screen-size sensitive CSS files.  This will record attempts at responsiveness, but not the quality.
		Checking for site-size vs browser-size would involve building in-browser plugin (possible, but time-consuming)
		
	Image quality
		Unless this only cares about image resolution, this would be impossible to automate, so we'd need people to manually check this
		
	Can I get a list of 5 or 6 sites that have mobile redirect set up?

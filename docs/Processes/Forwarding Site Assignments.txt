Process: Forward Site Assignments

	Purpose
		Some URLs forward to others, and some were just entered incorrectly to Salesforce. When Sites are checked for forwarding and validation, many are marked as redirecting to other Sites, resulting in a chain of Sites. Through Site resolutions, account imports, and other reasons, SalesforceAccount objects' assigned Sites	may not reflect the end of this chain.  This process follows redirect chains to assign the correct Site object for each SalesforceAccount without an 'APPROVED' Site.
		
	Input
		Keylist of SalesforceAccounts with Sites with the 'REDIRECTS' or 'MANUALLY_REDIRECTS' status
	
	Outcome
		SalesforceAccounts are all assigned Sites found at the end of a redirect chain
		
	Process Description
		Pull keylist of SalesforceAccounts with Sites with the 'REDIRECTS' or 'MANUALLY_REDIRECTS' status
		Iterate over list, pulling Site objects to recursively follow redirect chain to find last Site
		Assign last Site to SalesforceAccount
